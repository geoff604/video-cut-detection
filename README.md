# video-cut-detection
JavaScript video player that plays a ding sound on every cut

## Instructions

Visit example page at: https://geoff604.github.io/video-cut-detection/

Select your video.
Select your ding sound (optional).

Then start playing the video, and you'll hear the ding sound you selected when a cut is detected in the video.

You can try adjusting the sensitivity slider if the dings are happening too often or not enough.

## Don't have a video to try?
You can try this one (download it to your computer first):

## Why is this idea helpful?
Often when we watch videos, we are not aware that the video has a abrupt cut.
This tool allows for insight into how the video was edited.
